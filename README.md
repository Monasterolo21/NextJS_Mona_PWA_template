This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project template made by [Me](https://github.com/Monasterolo21), it uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). The main features I added are:

- [x] TypeScript
- [x] TailwindCSS
- [x] ESLint
- [x] Prettier
- [x] Serwist for PWA support
- [x] Sonner for toast notifications
- [x] Docker support
- [x] Shadcn as UI kit
- [x] Dark mode toggle

If you need to find pre-made components, you can use [Shadcn](https://shadcn.com) as a UI kit. It's a great tool to make your project look better and more professional. Make sure to also check out this amazing [website](https://awesome-shadcn-ui.vercel.app/) to find more components and examples.

MAKE SURE TO COMPLETE THE TODO IN ORDER TO MAKE THE TEMPLATE AS YOUR OWN PROJECT

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Docker support

To run the project with Docker, you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
